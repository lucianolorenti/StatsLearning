# Theory

# Excercises

1. Each of the following hypothetical data sets represents some repeated weighings of a standard weight that is known to have a mass of 100 g. Assume that the readings are a random sample from a population that follows the normal curve. Perform a t test to see whether the scale is properly calibrated, if possible. If impossible, explain why.
    a. 100.02, 99.98, 100.03
    ```{r}
        data = c(100.02, 99.98, 100.03)
        X = mean(data)
        sigma = sd(data)
                
    ```
    b. 100.01
It is impossible to perform a t-test with only one sample
